**Pod Networking in Container Engine for Kubernetes (OKE)**

In clusters created using Container Engine for Kubernetes (OKE), pod networking enables communication to and from pods on worker nodes. Here's an overview:

1. **Kubernetes Networking Model**: Pods have unique and routable IP addresses within the cluster. Pods utilize these IP addresses for communication with each other, with control plane nodes, across clusters, with services, and with the internet.

2. **Container Network Interface (CNI)**: Kubernetes adopts the CNI specification for network resource management. CNI plugins configure network interfaces, provision IP addresses, and maintain connectivity for pods running on worker nodes.

3. **Network Types and CNI Plugins**:
   - **VCN-Native Pod Networking**: Utilizes the OCI VCN-Native Pod Networking CNI plugin.
   - **Flannel Overlay**: Utilizes the flannel CNI plugin.
   - All node pools within a cluster use the same CNI plugin, determined by the network type selected during cluster creation.

4. **Cluster Add-Ons**:
   - The CNI plugin used for pod networking is considered an essential cluster add-on.
   - Automatic deployment or manual version selection for CNI plugin updates is possible.
   - Both OCI VCN-Native Pod Networking and flannel CNI plugins support Kubernetes NetworkPolicy resources, enabling the use of Calico for enhanced network security.

5. **Compatibility and Versioning**:
   - OCI VCN-Native Pod Networking CNI plugin is compatible with Kubernetes 1.22 or later.
   - Prior to July 2022, clusters used the flannel CNI plugin by default. Post-July 2022, OCI VCN-Native Pod Networking is the default (Console-created clusters running Kubernetes 1.22+), but flannel remains available for selection in the 'Custom Create' workflow and through the API.

6. **Usage**:
   - OCI VCN-Native Pod Networking: Compatible with both virtual and managed node pools.
   - Flannel CNI plugin: Compatible only with managed node pools.

By understanding pod networking in OKE clusters, users can optimize communication and networking configurations according to their requirements and preferences.
