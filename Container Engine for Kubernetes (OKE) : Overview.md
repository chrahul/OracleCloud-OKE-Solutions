# Container Engine for Kubernetes (OKE) : Overview

- Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Container Engine for Kubernetes (OKE) is a fully managed, scalable, and highly available service for deploying containerized applications to the Cloud.
  
- OKE offers flexibility in choosing between virtual nodes or managed nodes for running applications, provisioning them efficiently within your OCI tenancy.

- Utilizes Kubernetes, an open-source system simplifying deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications through pod grouping.

- OKE uses Kubernetes versions certified as conformant by CNCF and is ISO compliant (ISO-IEC standards 27001, 27017, and 27018) for a secure and reliable platform.

- Cluster creation is simplified using the intuitive console and robust REST API, with management capabilities provided through kubectl, Kubernetes dashboard, and API.

- Oracle manages master nodes (control plane nodes) including components like etcd, API server, and controller manager, distributed across different availability domains for reliability.

- OKE seamlessly integrates with container lifecycle management products, including container registries, CI/CD frameworks, networking solutions, storage options, and security features.

- Provides granular access control to production clusters, empowering developers with quick container deployment, and offering visibility and control for seamless Kubernetes management to DevOps teams.

- Blends Kubernetes container orchestration with Oracle's advanced cloud infrastructure, ensuring robust control, top-tier security, IAM, and consistent performance.

- OKE simplifies the building and maintenance of Kubernetes environments, making it less complex, costly, and time-consuming, resulting in efficient container deployment and management.
