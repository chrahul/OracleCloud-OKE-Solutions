**Serverless Kubernetes with Virtual Nodes**

Virtual nodes, a feature offered on OKE, to improve node management efficiency and reduce manual work. 


**Understanding Managed Nodes:**
- Managed nodes run on compute instances within your tenancy and are at least partly managed by you.
- Nodes are responsible for running collections of ports or containers and consist of components like kubelet and container runtime.
- Managed nodes offer flexibility for configuration to meet specific workload requirements, but require manual management and expertise.

**Introduction to Virtual Nodes:**
- Virtual nodes are fully managed and highly available nodes that resemble real nodes to Kubernetes.
- They are built using the CNCF virtual Kubernetes project, providing a translation layer between OCI and Kubernetes.
- OCI is the first major Cloud provider to offer a fully managed virtual Kubernetes product.
- Virtual nodes simplify scaling patterns and enable customers to scale applications quickly without worrying about underlying infrastructure.
- Customers only pay for resources used by their containerized applications, optimizing costs and avoiding payment for unused resources.
- Virtual nodes can support over 10 times the number of ports compared to normal nodes, reducing operational burden and facilitating application scaling.

**Key Features of Virtual Nodes:**
1. **Fully Managed Experience:** Customers don't have to manage underlying infrastructure, allowing them to focus solely on their applications.
2. **Simplified Scaling:** Quick scaling of containerized applications without worrying about underlying infrastructure.
3. **Cost Optimization:** Pay only for resources used by containerized applications, avoiding payment for unused resources.
4. **Increased Scalability:** Support for over 10 times the number of ports compared to normal nodes, facilitating scaling of applications.
5. **Integration with OCI Functionalities:** Customers can leverage OCI's container instances for strong isolation and ultimate elasticity with respect to compute capacity.

**Conclusion:**
- Virtual nodes on OCI OKE offer a serverless Kubernetes experience, enabling customers to focus solely on their containerized applications without worrying about managing the underlying infrastructure.
