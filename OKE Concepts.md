### Container Engine and Kubernetes Concepts

#### Kubernetes Clusters
- A Kubernetes cluster is a collection of nodes, including control plane nodes and worker nodes organized into node pools. Control plane nodes manage the cluster's state and configuration, while worker nodes execute the application workloads.

#### Enhanced and Basic Clusters
- Enhanced clusters offer advanced features such as virtual nodes, add-on management, and workload identity, with a financially-backed SLA. Basic clusters provide core Kubernetes functionality without these additional features and come with a service level objective (SLO).

#### Cluster Control Plane and Kubernetes API
- The cluster control plane encompasses components like kube-apiserver, kube-controller-manager, kube-scheduler, and etcd. These components manage cluster-wide operations and expose the Kubernetes API for interacting with the cluster.

#### Kubernetes Worker Nodes and Node Pools
- Worker nodes are instances where containers are deployed and executed. Node pools allow grouping worker nodes with similar configurations, enabling administrators to manage nodes with consistent settings.

#### Virtual Nodes and Managed Nodes
- Virtual nodes are ephemeral compute resources provisioned on-demand by the cloud provider, offering a serverless experience for running containerized workloads. Managed nodes are traditional compute instances provisioned and managed by the user, offering more control over configuration and maintenance.

#### Self-Managed Nodes
- Self-managed nodes, also known as Bring Your Own Nodes (BYON), are compute instances created and managed by users outside of the Kubernetes platform. These nodes can be integrated into a Kubernetes cluster for running workloads.

#### Pods
- Pods are the smallest deployable units in Kubernetes, consisting of one or more containers that share networking and storage resources. Containers within the same pod can communicate with each other over the localhost interface.

#### Services
- Kubernetes Services define sets of pods and provide a stable endpoint for accessing them. They enable load balancing and service discovery within the cluster, allowing applications to communicate with each other seamlessly.

#### Container Network Interface (CNI) Plugins
- CNI plugins are responsible for configuring network connectivity for pods running on worker nodes. These plugins provision network interfaces, assign IP addresses, and manage network policies to facilitate communication between pods.

#### Manifest Files (or Pod Specs)
- Kubernetes manifest files, typically written in YAML or JSON, describe the desired state of Kubernetes resources such as pods, deployments, and services. These files are used to create, update, or delete resources within the cluster.

#### Admission Controllers
- Admission controllers are plug-ins in the Kubernetes API server that intercept and modify requests before they are persisted to the cluster's etcd database. They enforce security policies, validate resource configurations, and perform mutation operations on incoming requests.

#### Namespaces
- Kubernetes namespaces provide a mechanism for logically partitioning cluster resources. They enable multiple users or teams to share a Kubernetes cluster while isolating their resources from each other. Kubernetes clusters come with default namespaces like `default`, `kube-system`, and `kube-public` for organizing resources.
