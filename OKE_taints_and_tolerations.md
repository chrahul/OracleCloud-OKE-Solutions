To ensure that a specific set of pods run only on a specific node pool in your Kubernetes Oracle Kubernetes Engine (OKE) cluster, you can use taints and tolerations. Here’s a step-by-step guide with an example:

### Step 1: Identify Your Node Pools
Let's assume you have two node pools:
- Node Pool A
- Node Pool B

You want to run specific pods only on Node Pool A.

### Step 2: Taint the Nodes in Node Pool A

1. **Get the nodes in Node Pool A**:
   ```sh
   kubectl get nodes --label-columns=nodepool
   ```

2. **Taint the nodes in Node Pool A**:
   ```sh
   kubectl taint nodes <node-name> key=value:NoSchedule
   ```
   For example, if you want to use the key `nodepool` and value `A`, the command would be:
   ```sh
   kubectl taint nodes <node-name> nodepool=A:NoSchedule
   ```
   Do this for each node in Node Pool A.

### Step 3: Add Tolerations to the Pods

1. **Edit your Pod or Deployment YAML file**:
   You need to add the tolerations section to your pod specification. Here’s an example of a pod definition that tolerates the taint `nodepool=A:NoSchedule`:

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Pod
   metadata:
     name: my-app
   spec:
     containers:
     - name: my-app-container
       image: my-app-image
     tolerations:
     - key: "nodepool"
       operator: "Equal"
       value: "A"
       effect: "NoSchedule"
   ```

   If you are using a Deployment, the tolerations would be added under the `template.spec` section:

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: apps/v1
   kind: Deployment
   metadata:
     name: my-app
   spec:
     replicas: 3
     selector:
       matchLabels:
         app: my-app
     template:
       metadata:
         labels:
           app: my-app
       spec:
         containers:
         - name: my-app-container
           image: my-app-image
         tolerations:
         - key: "nodepool"
           operator: "Equal"
           value: "A"
           effect: "NoSchedule"
   ```

### Step 4: Apply the Configuration

Apply the taint and toleration configurations:

1. **Apply the taint** (if not done already):
   ```sh
   kubectl taint nodes <node-name> nodepool=A:NoSchedule
   ```

2. **Apply the pod or deployment configuration**:
   ```sh
   kubectl apply -f my-app-deployment.yaml
   ```

### Step 5: Verify the Configuration

1. **Check the nodes**:
   Ensure the taint is applied:
   ```sh
   kubectl describe node <node-name> | grep -i taints
   ```

2. **Check the pod scheduling**:
   Verify that the pods are scheduled on the correct nodes:
   ```sh
   kubectl get pods -o wide
   ```

### Full Example

Here is a full example of a Deployment YAML with tolerations:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-app
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: my-app
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: my-app-container
        image: my-app-image
      tolerations:
      - key: "nodepool"
        operator: "Equal"
        value: "A"
        effect: "NoSchedule"
```

Apply the deployment:
```sh
kubectl apply -f my-app-deployment.yaml
```

By following these steps, you can ensure that the specific set of pods runs only on the nodes in Node Pool A by using taints and tolerations.
